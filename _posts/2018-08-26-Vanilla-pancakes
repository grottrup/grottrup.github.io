These are my favorite pancakes. It is a modification of an old recipe that has been taken of the internet, so I decided to preserve it on my own page.

This portion is recommended for up to 4 people

- 125 g / 2 dl flour
- 3 dl milk
- 2 eggs
- 30 g butter / magarine
- 1 tsp of salt
- 1 tsp vanilla sugar

1) Mix flour, milk, salt and vanillar sugar
2) Mix with eggs
3) Melt the butter and mix it with the rest
4) Bake the pancakes :)
