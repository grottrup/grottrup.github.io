## 8-2

Transform the following sinusoids into phasor form and
draw a phasor diagram. Use the additive property of phasors
to find i1(t) þ i2(t).
(a) i1(t) ¼ 4 sin(vt) A
(b) i2(t) ¼ 3 cos(vt  26.6) A

### Knowledge

#### Sinusoid

A signal with the form of the sine or cosine function.

A curve similar to the sine function, but it can be shifted in phase, period and amplitude:

$f(x)=a * \sin(\omega*x+c)$

$a$ : amplitude

$\omega$ : angular frequency

$c$ : phase

#### Phasor

A phasor is a complex number representing a sinusoidal
waveform. The magnitude and angle of the phasor
correspond to the amplitude and phase angle of the
sinusoid. The phasor does not provide frequency
information.

Phasors are time invariant.

#### Adittive property of phasors

### Exercise

We need to remove the frequency and the sin/cos.

**(a)** $i_1(t) = -4 \sin(\omega t) A$

To mark that you use amps is not needed when calculating. We change around which value is the negative one because???? To make it into cosinus???

$i_1(t) = 4 (-\sin(\omega t))$

When sinus is negative it is the same as cosinus added with $90\degree$.

$cos(x+90\degree)=-\sin(x)$

$i_1(t) = 4 (\cos(\omega t + 90\degree))$

Thus we now have a more conveinient value????? to find the phasor representation of $i_1(t)$

When finding the phasor representation you must????. The time invariant phasor is represented with $I$.

First we remove the time and angular frequency???

$I_1 = 4 \angle 90\degree$

We use Euler's formula when finding the phasor for the sinoid???? 

$r \angle \theta = r e^{j\theta} = r(\cos(\theta) + j \sin(\theta) = x + j y$

Since it is not in regars to the time x will be 0????

$I_1 = 4 \angle 90\degree = 4e^{j90} = 4(\cos(90\degree) + j \sin(90\degree)) = 0 + j 4$

Why do we want polar form and sum form?

Sum form is easy to add together while polar form is not.
